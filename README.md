# Giphy App
(https://bowenbrinegar.github.io/giphy/) \
The goal for this project was to create an App with the Giphy API. 


# Challenges and Solutions

### How do make the results appear had have pagination (or in this particular case, 'Infinite Scroll')
To handle this I worked with parameter changes in the API request. Which was initially difficult \
as this was one of my first projects using an API. I had to sit down a think how to seperate the \
functions so they could work the way I wanted to.
                   
                   
### How do approach the UI of the project. 
I wanted the project to feel good when used and I knew that meant some creative styling. Before \
finding Masonry.js by Desandro, I found multiple ways to stack items of varying heights throughout \
four coloums, but the same effect of a Pinterest type app could be achieved through lists. This \
also have limitations on the implemenation of 'infinite scrolling'

A second piece (which unfortunately only works if you download the repo and run the page locally), was \
animating the incoming GIFs. This was my first experience working with the Node Package Manager.
